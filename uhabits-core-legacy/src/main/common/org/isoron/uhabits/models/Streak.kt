/**
 * A streak is an uninterrupted sequence of days where the habit was performed.
 *
 * For daily boolean habits, the definition is straightforward: a streak is a
 * sequence of days that have checkmarks. For non-daily habits, note
 * that automatic checkmarks (the ones added by the app) can also keep the
 * streak going. For numerical habits, a streak is a sequence of days where the
 * user has consistently exceeded the target for the habit.
