/**
 * A Score is a number which indicates how strong the habit is at a given date.
 *
 * Scores are computed by taking an exponential moving average of the values of
 * the checkmarks in preceding days. For boolean habits, when computing the
 * average, each checked day (whether the check was manual or automatic) has
 * value as 1, while days without checkmarks have value 0.
 *
 * For numerical habits, each day that exceeded the target has value 1, while
 * days which failed to exceed the target receive a partial value, based on the
 * proportion that was completed. For example, if the target is 100 units and
 * the user completed 70 units, then the value for that day is 0.7 when
 * computing the average.
